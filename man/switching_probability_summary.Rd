\title{Compute Switching Probability Summary}
\usage{
switching_probability_summary(df, covariates = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data.frame from \code{preprocess_data()}, containing at least:
\code{pat_id}, \code{k_idx}, \code{A}, \code{Y_prev}, and any additional covariates.}

\item{covariates}{Character vector of covariate names to include in the hazard model,
or NULL for only \code{Y_prev} and \code{k_idx}.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{switching_summary}, which is a list with components:
\describe{
\item{\code{df2}}{Data.frame including original columns plus:
\code{hazard} (predicted probability of switching at each interval),
\code{surv_prob} (probability of not yet switched before each interval),
\code{switch_prob} (joint probability of surviving to interval and switching at that interval).}
\item{\code{summary_df}}{Data.frame summarizing \code{switch_prob} by \code{k_idx}:
mean, median, 5th percentile, 25th, 75th, and 95th percentiles.}
\item{\code{model}}{The fitted \code{glm} object (family = binomial).}
}
}
\description{
Fit a discrete-time logistic hazard model for treatment initiation ("switching"),
compute subject-level switching probabilities per interval, and summarize by interval.
}
\details{
This function fits a logistic regression for the hazard of initiating treatment
at each discrete interval, then computes for each subject the survival probability
(not yet switched) and the switching probability at each interval. It returns
the augmented data.frame and a summary by interval.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Suppose processed_df is the output of preprocess_data()
sw <- switching_probability_summary(processed_df, covariates = c("age", "sex"))
print(sw)       # prints summary_df
summary(sw)     # same as print
plot(sw)        # draws boxplot + mean curve
}
