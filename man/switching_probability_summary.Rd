\title{Compute switching-probability summary}
\usage{
switching_probability_summary(
  df,
  covariates = NULL,
  scale = c("mass", "hazard")
)

\method{print}{switching_summary}(x, ...)

\method{summary}{switching_summary}(object, ...)

\method{plot}{switching_summary}(x, type = c("boxplot", "line"), ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A \code{data.frame} (e.g., from \code{preprocess_data()}) containing at least
a subject id, a time index, and a binary treatment indicator.}

\item{covariates}{Optional character vector of column names in \code{df} to adjust for
in the switching hazard model. Default \code{NULL} (unadjusted).}

\item{scale}{Character string choosing the summary/plot scale.
"mass" (default) shows the marginal probability of initiating at interval k
(proportion of the cohort that starts at k); "hazard" shows the conditional
probability of initiating at k among those still at risk at k. This choice
affects both the returned summary and what \code{plot()} displays.}

\item{x}{an object used to select a method.}

\item{...}{Passed to \code{ggplot2::geom_boxplot()} when \code{type="boxplot"}.}

\item{object}{A \code{switching_summary} object.}

\item{type}{One of \code{"boxplot"} (per-interval boxplots of per-subject
indicators with mean -+ 95\% Wald bars overlaid) or \code{"line"} (mean curve with
95\% ribbon). Defaults to \code{"boxplot"}.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{switching_summary} with components:
\itemize{
\item \code{df_haz}: row-level data with indicators for at-risk status and the
computed \code{switch_prob} on the chosen scale;
\item \code{by_k}: interval-level summary with columns
\code{k_idx}, \code{n_at_risk}, \code{mean}, \code{sd_}, \code{se}, \code{lo95}, \code{hi95}, \code{p25}, \code{p50}, \code{p75};
here \code{mean} is computed as \code{sum(switch_prob, na.rm = TRUE) / N_ids};
\item \code{model}: the fitted logistic regression used to estimate the initiation
hazard on at-risk rows;
\item \code{id_col}, \code{time_col}, \code{treat_col}, \code{death_col}: resolved column names;
\item \code{scale}: the selected scale (\code{"mass"} or \code{"hazard"}).
}
}
\description{
Summarize how often subjects initiate treatment across follow-up intervals
on two complementary scales:
\itemize{
\item mass: the cohort-level probability that initiation occurs at interval k
(proportion of subjects whose first initiation is exactly at k);
\item hazard: the cohort-level average of the per-subject initiation hazard at k
among those at risk at k (initiation is defined as switching from 0 to 1).
}
}
\details{
The data are ordered by subject and time. Within each subject the function
constructs the lagged treatment \code{A_prev}, an at-risk indicator that requires
survival up to the start of interval k (if a terminal-event column is present)
and no prior initiation (\code{A_prev == 0}), and an initiation indicator at k.
A logistic regression is fit on the at-risk rows with response \code{init_k} and
predictors \verb{factor(<time index column>)} (for example, \code{factor(k_idx)}) plus
any \code{covariates}. Predicted hazards are assigned to at-risk rows. On the mass
scale, the per-subject probability of first initiation at k is computed as the
subject's survival up to k-1 (the product over prior at-risk rows of one minus
the predicted hazard) multiplied by the predicted hazard at k. The interval-level
table \code{by_k} reports a cohort-level mean and Wald-type 95\% limits based on a
normal approximation with standard error \code{sd_ / sqrt(N_ids)}, along with
selected quantiles of \code{switch_prob} for descriptive dispersion.
