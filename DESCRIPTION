Description: Implements the Bayesian framework of Oganisian et al. (2024) for causal inference with recurrent-event outcomes subject to a terminating event (e.g., death) and timing mis-alignment between eligibility and treatment initiation. Functions preprocess long-format data, fit a joint discrete-time hazard/count model in Stan with autoregressive priors, and apply g-computation to estimate marginal causal incidence-rate contrasts under hypothetical treatment-switching strategies. Utilities provide MCMC and positivity diagnostics, switching-probability summaries, effect curves, and publication-ready plots. Suitable for observational studies with right-censoring, time-varying confounding, and sparse late-follow-up intervals.
